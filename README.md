A light & nimble modular fork of [phaser](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/)

![Phaser 2.0](http://www.phaser.io/images/phaser2-github.png)

# Goals

* should build easily & modularly for CommonJS systems. Browserify can export all the other modular systems, so this works well for everyone
* all dependencies tracked as external & not in this repo
* We left out documentation & shims for various systems. We want a definitive physics engine, etc. If you ened other things, be sure to check out [phaser](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/)
* We left builds out. You should build it on your own system
